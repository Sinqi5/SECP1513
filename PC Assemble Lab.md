## Reflection :
â—ˆ What have I gained ? <br><br>
During the PC assembly lab, I had a chance to learn details on how a PC's hardware constitutes a CPU. Under the guidance of experts, we learned how to assemble the components, and also install them back safely. I also have a strong impression of the role of each component while assembling each component in order.
