# SECP1513-TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM
Section : 08 <br>
Lecturer : DR SURIATI BINTI SADIMON <br>
## Reflection :
This course enables me to learn about the subject through a variety of methods such as theoretical studies, hands-on labs, industrial talks, and design thinking projects. When I could acquire both technical knowledge and practical skills at the same time, I became more confident that I could contribute well in the field, either in further academic or professional contexts. I have understood the role technology and information systems play in this modern era and the career path that could be chosen in the future. The requirement of teamwork for every assignment has turned out to be a lesson of the importance of collaborating and well communicating in order to reach the same goal effectively.

## Assignment 1 : 
★ What I Have Gained <br>
In the industrial talk given by the EY Technology Consultant, I learned how technology nowadays applies in different fields. Not only that, I could learn from the experts' practical experience about their daily roles and responsibilities in a Big Four company. I also have more learning about the EY company such as their strategies to expand their company business opportunity and their expertise in leveraging technology implementation on consulting services.
