## Reflection :
This course enables me to learn about the subject through a variety of methods such as theoretical studies, hands-on labs, industrial talks, and design thinking projects. When I could acquire both technical knowledge and practical skills at the same time, I became more confident that I could contribute well in the field, either in further academic or professional contexts. I have understood the role technology and information systems play in this modern era and the career path that could be chosen in the future. The requirement of teamwork for every assignment has turned out to be a lesson of the importance of collaborating and well communicating in order to reach the same goal effectively.

★ What I Have Gained <br>
Through this work I also learned the need to use a user-centered practice when handling problems by implementing a design thinking methodology. Working on projects together with teammates taught me the importance of bringing different viewpoints and abilities together to generate a new one, such as the "Feast Finders" app. Besides, this experience also effectively trained my capacity of managing jobs successfully, doing communication well, and putting efforts into cooperation. I also discovered the benefits of clear and collaborative communication in solving problems. Generally, this has been the experience from which my teamwork has been improved, as well as the lesson, on how to modify strategies to sustain both productivity and inclusivity.
